# Transaction Microservice

## Introduction
The Transaction Microservice is a component of a larger system designed to handle financial transactions. This microservice provides functionalities for managing transactions, creating accounts, and ensuring security through authentication. It is built using Spring Boot, a popular Java framework for building web applications and microservices.

## Project Structure
The project structure adheres to the standard Maven layout:

```

```

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Simplifies the setup and development of Spring applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Provides a powerful way to interact with databases.
- **H2 Database**: Lightweight in-memory database for development and testing.
- **Resilience4j**: Library for implementing resilience patterns such as retry and circuit breaker.
- **Spring Security**: Provides authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Jakarta Bean Validation**: Enables input validation using annotations.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and project build tool.

## Configuration

### Database Configuration
The application uses an H2 in-memory database for simplicity. Database schema and initial data are defined in `schema.sql` and `data.sql` files, respectively. Modify these files as needed to match your data model and initial data requirements.

### Application Configuration
Application properties are defined in `application.properties`. This includes settings related to the datasource, Resilience4j, and Spring Security. Customize these properties according to your environment and application needs.

### Security Configuration
Security settings are configured in `SecurityConfig.java`. This class defines authentication and authorization rules using Spring Security. Modify this configuration to suit your authentication requirements, such as integrating with an LDAP server or OAuth provider.

### Resilience4j Configuration
Retry and Circuit Breaker configurations are provided in `application.properties` under the `resilience4j.retry` and `resilience4j.circuitbreaker` sections, respectively. These configurations determine how the microservice handles failures and retries when communicating with external services. Adjust these settings based on your resilience requirements and the characteristics of your system.
